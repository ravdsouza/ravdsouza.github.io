            The Bee's Knees joint monitoring device is a device made by three University of Waterloo students for the Capstone project. The inspiration behind this device is the lack of proper recovery monitoring patients often have after their surgery. The device is meant to be mounted on a knee brace that one would wear after surgery, and tracks data about the range of motion and inflammation at the knee for the two weeks after surgery. The trends over time and insights pertaining to recovery can be viewed on the patient's dashboard and physical therapists have access to this information as well. The goal of this device is to ensure that everything is recoverying as intended and that any early signs of infection and inflammation are caught early.
